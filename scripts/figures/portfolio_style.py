"""Design system for the figure set.

These figures are meant to be looked at, on a GitHub README and later on a
website, so they are built to different rules from throwaway analysis plots:

  * one idea per figure, large enough to read at ~950px wide;
  * the takeaway is written on the chart, not left in a caption;
  * series are labelled where they sit, so the eye never travels to a legend;
  * no chart chrome that carries no information -- no boxes, no heavy grids, no
    tick marks, no colourbar where a direct label will do.

Every number drawn here is read from assets/results.json, which the benchmark
writes. Nothing is typed in, so a figure cannot disagree with the measured run.
